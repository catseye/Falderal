Tests for echo
==============

This Falderal document was written by Chris Pressey.  It is hereby placed in
the public domain.

This test suite is part of the Falderal internal tests.  It tests two
things: expansion of the `%(test-text)` variable, and correctly handling
the case where the program being tested does not end its output with
a new line.
