Tests for wc
============

This Falderal document was written by Chris Pressey.  It is hereby placed in
the public domain.

This test suite demonstrates how Falderal can specify tests for
functionalities which have multiple implementations.

-> Functionality "Count lines" is implemented by
-> shell command "wc -l"

-> Functionality "Count lines" is implemented by
-> shell command "wc -l >%(output-file)"

-> Functionality "Count lines" is implemented by
-> Haskell function WordCount:countLines

-> Tests for functionality "Count lines"

Lines are counted correctly.

| These are eight words
| that span
| three lines.
= 3

-> Tests for shell command "wc -l %(test-file)"

| These are eight words
| that span
| three lines.
= 3 input.txt

-> Functionality "Count words" is implemented by
-> shell command "wc -w"

-> Tests for functionality "Count words"

| These are eight words
| that span
| three lines.
= 8

| Here are eight words on a single line.
= 8

An intentionally failing test.

| Not four words!
= 4
